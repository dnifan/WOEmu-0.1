WOEmu 0.1
=========

Old WOEmu version 0.1, dates back to 2008

This source code has been released to the public for educational reasons. Since the code is over 5 years old, the protocol will NOT
be compatible with the current build of the game.

You can probably get it to run. You need to reconstruct the database though, and you also need the correct Wurm client version,
which is unknown to me as of this writing.
